# Using Python, Jupyter and Scripts


1. First clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:SamuelStori/tutorial.git`
    - If you have problems you may want to add your ssh key, please check https://docs.github.com/es/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
2. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Open terminal
4. `jupyter notebook`
	- Maybe at first you want to check that you are running in the actual kernel that you want: `import sys; print(sys.executable)` or in the terminal: `jupyter kernelspec list`
5. Code
6. Share: `conda env export â€“-from-history > environment.yml`
	- We use the --from-history flag to make it work across platforms.
